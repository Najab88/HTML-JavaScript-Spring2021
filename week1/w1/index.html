        Hello!
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Naja Brown. I am 32 years old. I was born in Virginia and moved to Rhode Island when I was 7 years old. I have 3 children (boy 11, and twin girls 3). In my spare time, I like to play video games, create graphics on the computer and any type of arts and crafts. My favorite video games are League of legends, Destiny 2, and Beat Saber. I love to watch Anime and read Manga (anything bloody with tons of action!).

        Darkness is my best friend; mornings can be tough for me, and I might melt if I go out into the sun. I have been a PlayStation fan since the first one came out, and I hate to admit that I own them all except for the PS5. I have owned many gaming systems over the years, and I can’t wait for newer ones to be created. I need to have the latest technology in my hands, which can be costly at times. I hope we can be friends and play a lot of games together.
       Thanks for visiting my page!
