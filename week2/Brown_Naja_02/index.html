            <img src="images/naja.jpg" alt="profile picture">
            <p> <em> My name is Naja Brown.</em> I am 32 years old. I was born in
                Virginia and moved to Rhode Island when I was 7 years old. I
                have 3 children (boy 11, and twin girls 3). In my spare
                time, I like to play video games, create graphics on the
                computer and any type of arts and crafts. My favorite video
                games are League of legends, Destiny 2, and Beat Saber. I
                love to watch Anime and read Manga (anything bloody with
                tons of action!).
                <br>
                <br>
                Darkness is my friend; mornings can be tough for
                me, and I might melt if I go out into the sun. I have been a
                PlayStation fan since the first one came out, and I hate to
                admit that I own them all except for the PS5. I have owned
                many gaming systems over the years, and I canâ€™t wait for
                newer ones to be created. I need to have the latest
                technology in my hands, which can be costly at times. I hope
                we can be friends and play a lot of games together.
