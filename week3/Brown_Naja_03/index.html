                     My name is Naja Brown. I am 32 years old. I was born in
                    Virginia and moved to Rhode Island when I was 7 years old. I
                    have 3 children (boy 11, and twin girls 3). In my spare
                    time, I like to play video games, create graphics on the
                    computer and any type of arts and crafts. My favorite video games are League of legends, Destiny 2,
                    and
                    Beat Saber. I
                    love to watch Anime and read Manga (anything bloody with
                    tons of action!).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Darkness is my friend; mornings can be tough for
                    me, and I might melt if I go out into the sun. I have been a
                    PlayStation fan since the first one came out, and I hate to
                    admit that I own them all except for the PS5. I have owned
                    many gaming systems over the years, and I can’t wait for
                    newer ones to be created. I need to have the latest
                    technology in my hands, which can be costly at times. I hope
                    we can be friends and play a lot of games together.
